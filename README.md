# Text-to-Image Converter
## Problem Statement
Imagining images from the texts can be hard

## Solution
A **Chrome Extension** that can help users: 
- **Reading**: When reading but would not be able to imagine what is being written then a generated image can help users to imagine a picture of what has been written.
- **Creating PPTs**: Suppose wanting to give an analogy out of creativity but too much text wonâ€™t look catchy to the users, hence generating an image based on the given analogy would be a great idea.
